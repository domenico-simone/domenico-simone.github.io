My name is Domenico Simone and I am a passionate Bioinformatician, Data Scientist and Data Analyst.<br>
<br>
Since my PhD I have been devoted to Data Analysis in Biology, and during my professional experience I have worked with (meta-)genomics, (meta-)transcriptomics and molecular evolution. I have been involved in a lot of projects dealing with public health issues ([biomedical genomics](/portfolio/MToolBox/), SARS-CoV-2 and [bacterial pathogen surveillance](/portfolio/rmlst-api/), source attribution of foodborne pathogens).<br>
<br>
Recently I've started to get more and more interested in Data Science as a powerful tool to grasp the best insights from data. I am extremely fascinated by the possibility of running better science and business with these ever evolving technologies.<br>
<br>
A lot of my effort in my work is aimed at good communication and dissemination of results and methods. It's good to have a cellar full of fine wines, books and other commodities, but it's even better to share, isn't it?
