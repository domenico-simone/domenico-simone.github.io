Antimicrobials and antibiotics represent a milestone in the treatment of infectious diseases. However, their overuse and the misuse underlies the emergence and spread of microorganisms harbouring <b>antimicrobial resistance</b> (AMR). In this scenario, genomic surveillance of pathogens requires efficient detection of genes related to AMR and virulence factors (VF). To this purpose, several reference databases are publicly available for AMR and VF gene detection through similarity searching approaches (_e.g._ the [ABRicate](https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) tool). The [ABRicate dashboard](https://domenico-simone.shinyapps.io/unibo_01/) offers an interactive overview of genome screening results for antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes performed with ABRicate.
