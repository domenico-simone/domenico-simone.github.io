My name is Domenico Simone and I am a passionate Data Engineer, Python Developer and Bioinformatician.<br>
<br>
Since my PhD I have been devoted to Data Analysis in Biology, and during my professional experience I have worked with (meta-)genomics, (meta-)transcriptomics and molecular evolution. I have been involved in projects dealing with public health issues ([biomedical genomics](/portfolio/MToolBox/), SARS-CoV-2 and [bacterial pathogen surveillance](/portfolio/rmlst-api/), source attribution of foodborne pathogens). You can find further details about my professional path in [my cv](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4oznc4okjobiopeyiz2ql/Simone_Domenico_CV.pdf?rlkey=ria5zpcwxvjn2i0rn3vm732or&dl=0).<br>
<br>
An enthusiastic programmer in Python, Bash, and R, recently I've started to get more and more interested in Data Analytics, with a strong interest in Data Engineering as a powerful tool to grasp the best insights from data. I am extremely fascinated by the possibility of running better science and business with these ever evolving technologies.<br>
<br>
A lot of my effort in my work is aimed at good communication and dissemination of results and methods. It's good to have a cellar full of fine wines, books and other commodities, but it's even better to share, isn't it?
